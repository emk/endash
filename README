SproutCore Framework (Endash extensions)

This is a framework for containing preliminary code developed by
Endash (Christopher Swasey) for the Sproutcore framework.

Current contains the following:

views/divided.js
	A base class implementing a view divided into an
	arbitrary number of panes, with optional divider
	views to resize the panes.
	
views/split.js
	An extension to DividedView implementing some
	additional functionality, particularly by overriding
	certain methods to keep the SplitView a constant size
	and to adjust the sizes of its panes as needed to keep
	the SplitView optimally laid out.
	
	Includes a wrapper around Endash.SplitView that
	overrides SC.SplitView and translates its configuration
	as needed. Preliminary.
	
	showDividers: YES | NO
		what it says on the tin
		
	dividerSpacing: integer
		The space the view should allot for each divider

	dividerThickness: integer
		The actual size of each divider
		
	dividerView: view
		Endash.ThumbView by default
		
	childView:autoresize: YES | NO
	
	Example:
	
	split: Endash.SplitView.design({
		childViews: [
			SC.View.extend({layout: {
				minWidth: 200, 
				maxWidth: 300
			}}), 
			SC.View.extend({layout: {
				width: 245
			}, autoresize: NO}),
			SC.View
		]
	})
	
views/thumb.js
	A simple view which notifies its delegate of mouse
	events. Subclassed by DividedView to use as the dividers
	
mixins/thumb_delegate.js
	Delegate for ThumbView. Mixed into DividedView.

mixins/split_view_delegate.js
	Delegate for SplitView. Mixed into SplitView.
